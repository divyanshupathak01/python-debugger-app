535,538,Continuous Integration System for a Python Codebase,"<p>I'm starting work on a hobby project with a python codebase and would like to set up some form of continuous integration (i.e. running a battery of test-cases each time a check-in is made and sending nag e-mails to responsible persons when the tests fail) similar to CruiseControl or TeamCity.</p>

<p>I realize I could do this with hooks in most VCSes, but that requires that the tests run on the same machine as the version control server, which isn't as elegant as I would like. Does anyone have any suggestions for a small, user-friendly, open-source continuous integration system suitable for a Python codebase?</p>

972,2982,Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance,"<p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>Python</strong>, I think this is called <em>Monkey Patching</em> (or in some cases <em>Duck Punching</em>). I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

3976,4162,Programmatically talking to a Serial Port in OS X or Linux,"<p>I have a Prolite LED sign that I like to set up to show scrolling search queries from a apache logs and other fun statistics. The problem is, my G5 does not have a serial port, so I have to use a usb to serial dongle. It shows up as /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial . </p>

<p>When i do this everything seems to be hunky-dory:</p>

<pre><code>stty -f /dev/cu.usbserial
speed 9600 baud;
lflags: -icanon -isig -iexten -echo
iflags: -icrnl -ixon -ixany -imaxbel -brkint
oflags: -opost -onlcr -oxtabs
cflags: cs8 -parenb
</code></pre>

<p>Everything also works when I use the <a href=""http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24024"">serial port tool</a> to talk to it.</p>

<p>If I run this piece of code while the above mentioned serial port tool, everthing also works. But as soon as I disconnect the tool the connection gets lost. </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

import serial

ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbserial', 9600, timeout=10) 
ser.write(""&lt;ID01&gt;&lt;PA&gt; \r\n"") 
read_chars = ser.read(20)
print read_chars

ser.close()
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, what magicks do I need to perform to start talking to the serial port without the serial port tool? Is that a permissions problem? Also, what's the difference between /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial?</p>

<p>Nope, no serial numbers. The thing is, the problem persists even with sudo-running the python script, and the only thing that makes it go through if I open the connection in the gui tool that I mentioned.</p>
","Programmatically talking to a Serial Port in OS X or Linux <p>I have a Prolite LED sign that I like to set up to show scrolling search queries from a apache logs and other fun statistics. The problem is, my G5 does not have a serial port, so I have to use a usb to serial dongle. It shows up as /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial . </p>

<p>When i do this everything seems to be hunky-dory:</p>

<pre><code>stty -f /dev/cu.usbserial

iflags: -icrnl -ixon -ixany -imaxbel -brkint
oflags: -opost -onlcr -oxtabs

</code></pre>

<p>Everything also works when I use the <a href=""http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24024"">serial port tool</a> to talk to it.</p>

<p>If I run this piece of code while the above mentioned serial port tool, everthing also works. But as soon as I disconnect the tool the connection gets lost. </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

import serial

ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbserial', 9600, timeout=10) 
ser.write(""&lt;ID01&gt;&lt;PA&gt; \r\n"")

5966,10778,Best way to abstract season/show/episode data,"<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data?

28668,28692,Best way to extract data from a FileMaker Pro database in a script?,"<p>My job would be easier, or at least less tedious if I could come up with an automated way (preferably in a Python script) to extract useful information from a FileMaker Pro database. I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>

<p>I am currently aiming for Python and the Django framework as the technologies to implement that service with. I'm pretty sure I figure how to demonize the Python program in Linux. However, it is an optional spec item that the system should support Windows. I have little experience with Windows programming and no experience at all with Windows services.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to run a Python programs as a Windows service (i. e. run it automatically without user login)?</strong> I won't necessarily have to implement this part, but I need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these lines.</p>

<p><i>Edit: Thanks for all the answers so far, they are quite comprehensive. I would like to know one more thing: <b>How is Windows aware of my service? Can I manage it with the native Windows utilities?</b> <strong>Basically, what is the equivalent of putting a start/stop script in /etc/init.d?</i></strong></p>

43368,198348,A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?,"<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p>

<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>

<p>Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

58711,58917,"How would you design a very ""Pythonic"" UI framework?","<p>I have been playing with the Ruby library ""shoes"". Basically you can write a GUI application in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.</p>

<p>The scope of various stuff (say, the <code>la</code> label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..</p>

  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.</p>

<p>The scope of various stuff (say, the <code>la</code> label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..</p>

75621,75923,How to use form values from an unbound form,"<p>I have a web report that uses a Django form (new forms) for fields that control the query used to generate the report (start date, end date, ...). The issue I'm having is that the page should work using the form's initial values (unbound), but I can't access the cleaned_data field unless I call is_valid(). But is_valid() always fails on unbound forms.</p>

<p>It seems like Django's forms were designed with the use case of editing data such that an unbound form isn't really useful for anything other than displaying HTML.</p>

<p>For example, if I have:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'GET':
    form = MyForm()
else:

if form.is_valid():

       do_query(form.cleaned_data['start_date'], form.cleaned_data['end_date'])

78900,78990,How to check for memory leaks in Guile extension modules?,"<p>I develop an extension module for Guile, written in C.  This extension module embeds a Python interpreter.</p>

79454,80028,Testing GUI code: should I use a mocking library?,"<p>Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).</p>

<p>I chose a mocking library called <a href=""http://labix.org/mocker"" rel=""nofollow"">mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():
    def test(config):
        ac = AppController()
        m = Mocker()
        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)
        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))
        with m:
            result = ac.current_window_controller()
            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)
    yield test, []
    yield test, [0]
    yield test, [1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:</p>

<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):
    try:
        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting
        # with the controller of the top-most window
        # assumption: the top-most window is the ""current"" one
        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return wc
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.</p>

<p>I find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?</p>

<p>Am I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?</p>

87522,89434,"If it is decided that our system needs an overhaul, what is the best way to go about it?","<p>We are mainting a web application that is built on Classic ASP using VBScript as the primary language. We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>

<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>

106766,111199,Unit Testing File Modifications,"<p>A common task in programs I've been working on lately is modifying a text file in some way. (Hey, I'm on Linux. Everything's a file. And I do large-scale system admin.)</p>

<p>But the file the code modifies may not exist on my desktop box. And I probably don't want to modify it if it IS on my desktop.</p>

<p>I've read about unit testing in Dive Into Python, and it's pretty clear what I want to do when testing an app that converts decimal to Roman Numerals (the example in DintoP). The testing is nicely self-contained. You don't need to verify that the program PRINTS the right thing, you just need to verify that the functions are returning the right output to a given input.</p>

<p>In my case, however, we need to test that the program is modifying its environment correctly. Here's what I've come up with:</p>

<p>1) Create the ""original"" file in a standard location, perhaps /tmp.</p>

<p>2) Run the function that modifies the file, passing it the path to the file in /tmp.</p>

<p>3) Verify that the file in /tmp was changed correctly; pass/fail unit test accordingly.</p>

<p>This seems kludgy to me. (Gets even kludgier if you want to verify that backup copies of the file are created properly, etc.)  Has anyone come up with a better way?</p>

for example:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The only way I've found to tell pylint to not warn about these warnings is by blocking all errors of the type (E1101) which is not an acceptable solution, since that is (in my opinion) an extremely useful error.

The custom type is called Auth_credentialsData which contains 2 values as stings - one for the username and one for the password. How can I create this custom type using SOAPpy? I tried passing a list and a dictionary, none of which work.</p>

<p>Code so far:</p>

<pre><code>from SOAPpy import WSDL

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>credentials = {'username': 'email@example.com', 'password': 'passsword'}
client.Auth_login('key', credentials)

<p>both of which give an authentication failed error.</p>

118516,272170,How do I read an Excel file into Python using xlrd? Can it read newer Office formats?,"<p>My issue is below but would be interested comments from anyone with experience with xlrd.</p>

118540,119022,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

127736,219303,How to implement a Decorator with non-local equality?,"<p>Greetings, currently I am refactoring one of my programs, and I found an interesting problem.</p>

<p>I have Transitions in an automata. Transitions always have a start-state and an end-state. Some Transitions have a label, which encodes a certain Action that must be performed upon traversal. No label means no action. Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.</p>

<p>I need the following operations:  </p>

<ul>
<li>check if the transition has a label</li>
<li>get this label</li>
<li>add a label to a transition</li>
<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>
<li>get this condition</li>
<li>check for equality</li>
</ul>

<p>Judging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition. However, this approach has a problem: two transitions are considered equal if their start-state and end-state are the same, the labels at both transitions are equal (or not-existing) and both conditions are the same (or not existing). With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(""foo"", Conditional(""bar"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) and Conditional(""bar"", Labeled(""foo"", Transition(""baz"", ""qux""))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:</p>

<p>I don't care if the descriptions vary. I cannot throw them away because there is a chance that the protein database I am using will not contain a listing for a certain identifier. If this happens I will want to be able to display the human readable description to the biologists so they know roughly what protein they are looking at.</p>

<p>I am currently solving this problem by using a dictionary type. However I don't really like this solution because it uses a lot of memory (I have a lot of these ID's). This is only an intermediary listing of them. There is some additional processing the ID's go through before they are placed in the database so I would like to keep my data-structure smaller.</p>

<p>I have two questions really. First, will I get a smaller memory footprint using the Set type (over the dictionary type) for this, or should I use a sorted list where I check every time I insert into the list to see if the ID exists, or is there a third solution that I haven't thought of? Second, if the Set type is the better answer how do I key it to look at just the first element of the tuple instead of the whole thing? </p>

<p>based on some of the comments I received let me clarify a little. Most of what I do with data-structure is insert into it. I only read it twice, once to annotate it with additional information,* and once to do be inserted into the database. However down the line there may be additional annotation that is done before I insert into the database. Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. </p>

<p>Right now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space. Is there a better structure or is a hash-table about as good as it gets?</p>

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

<p>Here is the complete set of 43 built-in Macros that I see (yours may differ depending on which version of VS you use and which tools you have enabled):</p>

<pre>
    ConfigurationName  IntDir           RootNamespace      TargetFileName
    DevEnvDir          OutDir           SafeInputName      TargetFramework

</pre>

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

The servers will communicate with each other in a cluster. Part of the server's functionality involves selecting a small subset of rows from a potentially very large table.

<p>Simply writing the function in Python isn't really an option, since nobody is going to want to install a server that downloads and executes arbitrary Python code at runtime.</p>

<p>What I need are suggestions on the simplest way to implement a Domain Specific Language to achieve this goal. The language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation, as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows. Ease of writing and reading the language is secondary to ease of implementing it. I'd also prefer not to have to write an entire query optimiser, so something that explicitly specifies what indexes to query would be ideal.</p>

<p>The interface that this will have to compile against will be similar in capabilities to what the App Engine datastore exports: You can query for sequential ranges on any index on the table (eg, less-than, greater-than, range and equality queries), then filter the returned row by any boolean expression. You can also concatenate multiple independent result sets together.</p>

<p>I realise this question sounds a lot like I'm asking for SQL. However, I don't want to require that the datastore backing this data be a relational database, and I don't want the overhead of trying to reimplement SQL myself. I'm also dealing with only a single table with a known schema. Finally, no joins will be required. Something much simpler would be far preferable.</p>

140295,142802,Using locale.setlocale in embedded Python without breaking file parsing in C thread,"<p>We're using a third-party middleware product that allows us to write code in an embedded Python interpreter, and which exposes an API that we can call into. Some of these API calls allow us to load various kinds of file, and the loading code is implemented in C. File loading happens in a separate thread, and calls back into Python when the data is available. So far, all well and dandy.</p>

<p>We've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings. So, from Python, we do this:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this works (in that the user-facing numbers are formatted correctly for their locale). However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.</p>

<p>We can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards. That is, something like:</p>

<pre><code>import locale
currentLocale = locale.getLocale( locale.LC_ALL )
locale.setLocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
displayNumbersToTheUser()
locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, currentLocale )
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a bit clunky, and I was wondering whether this is a common approach to formatting locale-aware output for the user? My other concern is that this is obviously not thread safe, so we'll presumably still get problems if any file parsing occurs in a separate thread when the locale is changed.</p>

<p>Any information on best practice is appreciated - I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.</p>

Any number of them may be selected at once.  It would be great if there was something that could select/deselect them in the same (appearing at least) way that Windows does.  Then all I would need is a list of all the selected icons.</p>

<p>My problem is this: In Django, I am constantly reproducing the basic formatting for low-level database objects. Here's an example:</p>

<p>I have two classes, Person and Address. There are multiple Addresses for each Person, setup likeso (in their respective <strong>models.py</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>class Person(models.Model):
  ...

class Address(models.Model):
  contact = models.ForeignKey(Person)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever I look at a Person, I want to see all their Addresses. So suppose <strong>Persons/views.py</strong> has something likeso:</p>

<pre><code>def detail(request, person_id):
   person = get_object_or_404( Person, pk=person_id )
   return render_to_response('persons/details.html',
      { 'title' : unicode(person), 'addresses': person.address_set.all() } )
</code></pre>

<p>And, I have a template, <strong>persons/details.html</strong>, with code, for example, like-so:</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}

{% for address in addresses %}
&lt;b&gt;{{ address.name }}&lt;/b&gt;
  {{ address.type }} &lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_1 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.street_2 }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.city }} {{ address.stateprov }} {{ address.postalcode }}&lt;br&gt;
  {{ address.country }}
  &lt;hr&gt;
{{ endfor }}
</code></pre>

<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it's in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don't want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>

<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
{% for address in addresses %} 
  {% address.as_html4 %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>

<pre><code>{% extends ""base.html"" %}
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
{% for address in addresses %}
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/table&gt;

  <p>First motivation, money. I know, this
  doesn't sound like a great inspiration
  to many, and saying that money is one
  of the motivation factors might just
  blow my chances away. As if money is a
  taboo in programming world. I know
  there are people who can't be
  motivated by money. Kudos to them. Me,
  on the other hand, am living in a real
  world, with house mortgage to pay,
  myself to feed and bills to cover. So
  I can't really exclude money from my
  consideration.</p>
  
  <p>If I can get a large sum of money for
  doing a good job, then thatwill
  definitely boost my morale. I won't
  care whether I am using an old
  workstation, or forced to share rooms
  or cubicle with other people, or have
  to put up with an annoying boss, or
  whatever. The fact that at the end of
  the day I will walk off with a large
  pile of money itself is enough for me
  to overcome all the obstacles, put up
  with all the hard feelings and hurt
  egos, tolerate a slow computer and
  even endure</p>

147816,147878,Preserving signatures of decorated functions,"<p>Suppose I have written a decorator that does something very generic. For example, it might convert all arguments to a specific type, perform logging, implement memoization, etc.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())

    return x*y + 2*z

&gt;&gt;&gt; funny_function(""3"", 4.0, z=""5"")
22
</code></pre>

<p>Everything well so far. There is one problem, however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function g in module __main__:

g(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately, there is a workaround:</p>

<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        args = [int(x) for x in args]
        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())
        return f(*args, **kwargs)

    return g

@args_as_ints
def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""Computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the function name and documentation are correct:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)
Help on function funny_function in module __main__:

funny_function(*args, **kwargs)
    Computes x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>But there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information ""*args, **kwargs"" is next to useless.</p>

<p>What to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:</p>

<p>1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_function(x, y, z=3):
    """"""funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z""""""
    return x*y + 2*z
</code></pre>

<p>This is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]</p>

<p>2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:</p>

<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):
    def g(x, y, z=3):
        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))
    g.__name__ = f.__name__
    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return g
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?</p>

<p>Otherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of ""*kwargs, **kwargs"" when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?</p>

But it doesn't. Any ideas?</p>

<p>My view (for that output):</p>

<pre><code>def debug(request):
    order = Product.objects.all().order_by('order')
    return render_to_response('cms/debug.html', {'order' : order, 'name' : name})
</code></pre>

<p>And the view responsible for saving the order field:</p>

<pre><code>def manage_all(request):

if request.method == 'POST':
    PostEntries = len(request.POST)
    x = 1       
    while x &lt; PostEntries:
        p = Product.objects.get(pk=x)
        p.order = int(request.POST.get(str(x),''))
        print ""Itr: "" + str(x)
        x = x + 1
    p.save()
    print ""Product Order saved""     
    return HttpResponse(""Saved"")
</code></pre>

<p>And the model (without the boring bits):</p>

<pre><code>class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    order = models.IntegerField(blank = True, null = True
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a 'live' example of the page <a href=""http://massiveatom.com:8080/debug/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://massiveatom.com:8080/debug/</a> Please note that that is only running on the dev server, so it may not always be up.</p>

<p>I have asked in #django and they didn't seem to know what was going on. One thought was that the database/Django was being confused by the SQL command it is generating (<code>select * from table where 1 order by 'order'</code>), but I would prefer not to change the order field in the model.</p>

<p>And I know there should be back-ticks surrounding order in the above SQL command, but the syntax parsing thingy kinda hated on it...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Each object has the correct value, so I don't really know why it isn't sorting it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I don't know what was going on, but it turns out putting p.save() in the loop fixed it all...</p>

<p>The CPerson class however sometimes needs to use the CRoom class for the room its in, for example to find the door, or too see who else is in the room.</p>

","Python module dependency <p>Ok I have two modules, each containing a class, the problem is their classes reference each other.</p>

<p>Lets say for example I had a room module and a person module containing CRoom and CPerson.</p>

<p>The CRoom class contains infomation about the room, and a CPerson list of every one in the room.</p>

<p>The CPerson class however sometimes needs to use the CRoom class for the room its in, for example to find the door, or too see who else is in the room.</p>

<p>The problem is with the two modules importing each other I just get an import error on which ever is being imported second :(</p>

<p>In c++ I could solve this by only including the headers, and since in both cases the classes just have pointers to the other class, a forward declaration would suffice for the header eg:</p>

<pre><code>class CPerson;//forward declare
class CRoom
{
    std::set&lt;CPerson*&gt; People;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to do this in python, other than placing both classes in the same module or something like that?</p>

<p>edit: added python example showing problem using above classes</p>

158546,158753,Best way to store and use a large text-file in python,"<p>I'm creating a networked server for a boggle-clone I wrote in python, which accepts users, solves the boards, and scores the player input.  The dictionary file I'm using is 1.8MB (the ENABLE2K dictionary), and I need it to be available to several game solver classes.  Right now, I have it so that each class iterates through the file line-by-line and generates a hash table(associative array), but the more solver classes I instantiate, the more memory it takes up.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is import the dictionary file once and pass it to each solver instance as they need it.  But what is the best way to do this?  Should I import the dictionary in the global space, then access it in the solver class as globals()['dictionary']?  Or should I import the dictionary then pass it as an argument to the class constructor?  Is one of these better than the other?  Is there a third option?</p>

160009,160421,Model limit_choices_to={'user': user},"<p>I went to all the documentation, also I went to the IRC channel (BTW a great community) and they told me that is not possible to create a model and limit choices in a field where the 'current user' is in a ForeignKey.
I will try to explain this with an example:</p>

<pre><code>class Project(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
  employees = models.ManyToManyField(Profile, limit_choices_to={'active': '1'})

class TimeWorked(models.Model):
  project = models.ForeignKey(Project, limit_choices_to={'user': user})
  hours = models.PositiveIntegerField()

<p>Of course that code doesn't work because there is no 'user' object, but that was my idea and I was trying to send the object 'user' to the model to just limit the choices where the current user has projects, I don't want to see projects where I'm not in.</p>

<p>Thank you very much if you can help me or give me any advice, I don't want to you write all the app, just a tip how to deal with that. I have 2 days with this in my head and I can't figure it out :(</p>

","Model limit_choices_to={'user': user} <p>I went to all the documentation, also I went to the IRC channel (BTW a great community) and they told me that is not possible to create a model and limit choices in a field where the 'current user' is in a ForeignKey.
I will try to explain this with an example:</p>

<pre><code>class Project(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
  employees = models.ManyToManyField(Profile, limit_choices_to={'active': '1'})

class TimeWorked(models.Model):
  project = models.ForeignKey(Project, limit_choices_to={'user': user})
  hours = models.PositiveIntegerField()

160298,161082,Django/Python - Grouping objects by common set from a many-to-many relationships,"<p>This is a part algorithm-logic question (how to do it), part implementation question (how to do it best!). I'm working with Django, so I thought I'd share with that.</p>

<p>In Python, it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/773/how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby"">how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Car(models.Model):
    mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Mods(models.Model):
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>How does one get a list of Cars, grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p>

<p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p>

<pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ 
  { mods: { 'a' }, cars: { 'W1', 'W2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b' }, cars: { 'X1', 'X2', 'X3' }, },
  { mods: { 'b' }, cars: { 'Y1', 'Y2' } },
  { mods: { 'a', 'b', 'c' }, cars: { 'Z1' } },
]
</code></pre>

<p>I've been thinking of something like:</p>

<pre><code>def cars_by_common_mods():
  cars = Cars.objects.all()

  mod_list = []      

  for car in cars:
    mod_list.append( { 'car': car, 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } 

  ret = []

  for key, mods_group in groupby(list(mods), lambda x: set(x.mods)):
    ret.append(mods_group)

  return ret
</code></pre>

<p>However, that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say, I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating.</p>

160834,185505,Are there any other good alternatives to zc.buildout and/or virtualenv for installing non-python dependencies?,"<p>I am a member of a team that is about to launch a beta of a python (Django specifically) based web site and accompanying suite of backend tools.  The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.</p>

<p>I'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>

<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>

<p>$ git clone [repository url]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...</p>

<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>

<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>

<p>I know this seems to go against the general idea of private and public, but usually the class I am trying to subclass is one of my own which I am quite happy to expose the members from to a subclass but not to an instance of that class. Is there a clean way of providing this distinction?</p>
","Subclassing a class with private members <p>One of the really nice things about python is the simplicity with which you can name variables that have the same name as the accessor:</p>

163603,164769,Apache sockets not closing?,"<p>I have a web application written using CherryPy, which is run locally on <code>127.0.0.1:4321</code>.

<p>This all works just fine for small workloads.  However, I recently used <code>urllib2</code> to write a stress-testing script that would simulate a workload of 100 clients.  After some time, each client gets a 503 error from Apache, indicating that Apache cannot connect to <code>127.0.0.1:4321</code>.

<p>Googling for this error reveals that Apache has probably run out of socket file descriptors.  Since I only have 100 clients running, this implies that the connections are not being closed, either between my <code>urllib2</code> connection and Apache (I am definitely calling <code>.close()</code> on the return value of <code>urlopen</code>), or between Apache and CherryPy.</p>

166198,190233,How can I capture all exceptions from a wxPython application?,"<p>I'm writing a little debug app for a bit of kit we're developing and I'd like to roll it out to a few users to see if they can provoke any crashes.

168167,169779,Initializing cherrypy.session early,"<p>I love CherryPy's API for sessions, except for one detail.  Instead of saying <code>cherrypy.session[""spam""]</code> I'd like to be able to just say <code>session[""spam""]</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't simply have a global <code>from cherrypy import session</code> in one of my modules, because the <code>cherrypy.session</code> object isn't created until the first time a page request is made.  Is there some way to get CherryPy to initialize its session object immediately instead of on the first page request?</p>

<p>I have two ugly alternatives if the answer is no:</p>

<p>First, I can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>def import_session():

<p>My second solution is to do something like</p>

<pre><code>class SessionKludge:

<p>but this feels like an even bigger kludge and I'd need to do more work to implement the other dictionary functions such as <code>.get</code></p>

<p>So I'd definitely prefer a simple way to initialize the object myself.  Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

172392,179023,What symmetric cypher to use for encrypting messages?,"<p>I haven't a clue about encryption at all. But I need it. How?</p>

<p>Say you have a system of nodes communicating with each other on a network via asynchronous messages. The nodes do not maintain session information about other nodes (this is a design restriction).</p>

<p>Say you want to make sure only your nodes can read the messages being sent. I believe encryption is the sollution to that.</p>

<p>Since the nodes are not maintaining a session and communication must work in a stateless, connectionless fashion, I am guessing that asymmetric encryption is ruled out.</p>

<p>So here is what I would like to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>messages are sent as UDP datagrams</li>
<li>each message contains a timestamp to make messages differ (counter replay attacks)</li>
<li>each message is encrypted with a shared secret symmetric key and sent over the network</li>
<li>other end can decrypt with shared secret symmetric key</li>
</ul>

<p>Keys can obviously be compromised by compromising any single node. At the same time, in this scenario, access to any single compromised node reveals all interesting information anyway, so the key is not the weakest link.</p>

<p>What cypher should I use for this encryption? What key length?</p>

<p>I would prefer to use something supported by <a href=""http://www.freenet.org.nz/ezPyCrypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">ezPyCrypto</a>.</p>

194289,194306,Recommended data format for describing the rules of chess,"<p>I'm going to be writing a chess server and one or more clients for chess and I want to describe the rules of chess (e.g. allowable moves based on game state, rules for when a game is complete) in a programming language independant way. This is a bit tricky since some of the chess rules (e.g. King Castling, en passent, draws based on 3 or more repeated moves) are based not only on the board layout but also on the history of moves.</p>

<p>I would prefer the format to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>textual</li>

<li>based on a standard (e.g. YAML, XML)</li>
<li>easily parsable in a variety of languages</li>

194339,194472,Python Code Organization Question : Eggs + Packages + Buildout + Unit Tests + SVN,"<p>I have several python projects that share common modules. Until now, I've been ... ahem ... keeping multiple copies of the common code and synchronizing by hand. But I'd clearly prefer to do something else.</p>

<p>It looks to me now, as if zc.Buildout maybe what I need. I guess that what I should be doing is putting each reusable component of my system into a separate egg, and then using buildout to assemble them into projects.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking that for any particular module, I should put the unit-tests into a separate package or egg, so that I'm not also installing copies of the component's  unit-tests in every project. I only want to unit-test in a place where my library is developed, not where it's just being used.</p>

<p>So maybe I want something like this</p>

<pre><code>projects
  lib1
    tests
    code
  lib2
    tests
    code
  app1
    tests 
    appcode
  app2
    tests
    appcode
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Where both app1 and app2 are independent applications with their own code and tests, but are also including and using both lib1 and lib2. And lib1/test, lib1/code, lib2/test, lib2code, app1, app2 are separate eggs. Does this sound right?</p>

<p>However, I now get confused. I assume that when I develop app1, I want buildout to pull copies of lib1, lib2 and app1 into a separate working directory rather than put copies of these libraries under app1 directly. But how does this work with my SVN source-control? If the working directory is dynamically constructed with buildout, it can't be a live SVN directory from which I can check the changes back into the repository?</p>

<p>Have I misunderstood how buildout is meant to be used? Would I be better going for a completely different approach? How do you mix source-control with module-reuse between projects?</p>

<p>Update : thanks to the two people who've currently answered this question. I'm experimenting more with this.</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system(""C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe"");
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Then it fails with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>'C:\Temp\a' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>

<p>If I escape the program with quotes:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system('""C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe""');
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Then it works. However, if I add a parameter, it stops working again:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system('""C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe"" ""C:\\test.txt""');
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>What is the right way to execute a program and wait for it to complete? I do not need to read output from it, as it is a visual program that does a job and then just exits, but I need to wait for it to complete.</p>

<p>Also note, moving the program to a non-spaced path is not an option either.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> This does not work either:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system(""'C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe'"");
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Note the swapped single/double quotes.</p>

<p>with or without a parameter to notepad here, it fails with the error message</p>

<pre><code>The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

207290,207502,extracting a parenthesized Python expression from a string,"<p>I've been wondering about how hard it would be to write some Python code to search a string for the index of a substring of the form <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code>, for example, where <em>expr</em> is meant to be a Python expression or something resembling one.  Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.</p>

<p>I could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.</p>

<p>What's your sense?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Thanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.</p>

<p>The <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\{([^}]+)\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!</p>

<p>Prior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.</p>

213628,215507,How to convert a C string (char array) into a Python string when there are non-ASCII characters in the string?,"<p>I have embedded a Python interpreter in a C program.  Suppose the C program reads some bytes from a file into a char array and learns (somehow) that the bytes represent text with a certain encoding (e.g., ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252, or UTF-8).  How do I decode the contents of this char array into a Python string?</p>

<p>The Python string should in general be of type <code>unicode</code>âfor instance, a <code>0x93</code> in Windows-1252 encoded input becomes a <code>u'\u0201c'</code>.</p>

<p>I have attempted to use <code>PyString_Decode</code>, but it always fails when there are non-ASCII characters in the string.  Here is an example that fails:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

}
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is <code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u201c' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</code>, which indicates that the <code>ascii</code> encoding is used even though we specify <code>windows_1252</code> in the call to <code>PyString_Decode</code>.</p>

<p>The following code works around the problem by using <code>PyString_FromString</code> to create a Python string of the undecoded bytes, then calling its <code>decode</code> method:</p>

Looking in the Apache error_log, I get a stack trace that culminates in:</p>

<pre>
PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend:
  ExtractionError: Can't extract file(s) to egg cache

The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:

  [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.python-eggs'

The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:

  /.python-eggs

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory
</pre>

<p>So I explicitly set PYTHON_EGG_CACHE to /srv/trac/plugin-cache. I restarted Apache. Yet I get the same error (it still says ""egg cache directory current set to: \n\n /.python_eggs."")</p>

<p>How should I proceed? Is the simplest thing to do to reinstall Trac? If I go that route, what steps do I need to take to ensure that I don't lose existing data?</p>

I am trying to develop a script to pull some data from a large number of html tables.  One problem is that the number of rows that contain the information to create the column headings is indeterminate.  I have discovered that the last row of the set of header rows has the attribute border-bottom for each cell with a value.  Thus I decided to find those cells with the attribute border-bottom.  As you can see I initialized a list.  I intended to find the parent of each of the cells that end up in the borderCells list.  However, when I run this code only one cell, that is the first cell in allCells with the attribute border-bottom is added to the list borderCells.  For your information allCells has 193 cells, 9 of them have the attr border-bottom.  Thus I was expecting nine members in the borderCells list.  Any help is appreciated.</p>

216093,216145,How do I coherently organize modules for a PyGTK desktop application?,"<p>I am working on a desktop application in PyGTK and seem to be bumping up against some limitations of my file organization.  Thus far I've structured my project this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>
<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>
<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>
<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>
</ul>

<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>

<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>

<p>Should I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT I</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now.

<p>Should I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)? Perhaps that is what I'm missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.</p>

","How do I coherently organize modules for a PyGTK desktop application? <p>I am working on a desktop application in PyGTK and seem to be bumping up against some limitations of my file organization.  Thus far I've structured my project this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>
<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>
<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>
<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>
</ul>

<p>This has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.</p>

<p>I have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.</p>

<p>Should I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT I</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window.

Initially there were new sockets created and cleaned up properly but after an hour I found that it had about 509 sockets that were not cleaned. All the sockets were in CLOSE_WAIT state. I got this information using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>netstat -ap | grep ""4536"" | grep CLOSE_WAIT | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>CLOSE_WAIT state means that the remote client has closed the connection. Why is cherrypy then not closing the socket and free the file descriptors? What can I do to resolve the problem? </p>

<p>I tried to play with the following:</p>

<pre><code>cherrypy.config.update({'server.socketQueueSize': '10'})
</code></pre>

<p>I thought that this would restrict the number of sockets open at any time to 10 but it was not effective at all. This is the only config I have set, so , rest of the configs hold their default values.</p>

<p>Could somebody throw light on this? Do you think its a bug in cherrypy? How can I resolve it? Is there a way I can close these sockets myself?</p>

","What would be a better implementation of all combinations in lexicographic order of a jagged list? <p>I was put in a position today in which I needed to enumerate all possible combinations of jagged list. For instance, a naive approach would be:</p>

<pre><code>for a in [1,2,3]:
    for b in [4,5,6,7,8,9]:
        for c in [1,2]:
            yield (a,b,c)

<p>This is functional, but not general in terms of the number of lists that can be used. Here is a more generalized approach:</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import zeros, array, nonzero, max

make_subset = lambda x,y: [x[i][j] for i,j in enumerate(y)]

def combinations(items):
    num_items = [len(i) - 1 for i in items]

224337,224800,Alternatives to a wizard,"<p>I'm making a program that fits the wizard concept ideally; the user is walked through the steps to create a character for a game.</p>

<p>However, I'm realizing that the limitations of the wizard are making it difficult to design ""elegant"" logic flow. For example, because all pages of the wizard are initalized at the same time, I can't have the values entered in one page available to the next one. I have to put a button on each page to get the values from a previous page rather than simply having fields auto-populated.</p>

<p>I've thought about alternatives to using the wizard. I think the best idea is to have some buttons on one panel that change the information on another panel, e.g. a splitter window.</p>

<p>However, I can't find any documentation in wxPython on how to dynamically change the panel. Everything I've found so far is really pretty static, hence the use of the wizard. Even the ""wxPython in Action"" book doesn't mention it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this time the Jenkins project has replaced Hudson as the community version of the package. The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org"">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I'll stick with Hudson. <a href=""http://integrityapp.com/"">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=""http://buildbot.net/trac"">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>

<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download Hudson from <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>
<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>
<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click ""Update"" or similar</li>
<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>
<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>
<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it's not already</li>
<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>

","""Pretty"" Continuous Integration for Python <p>This is a slightly.. vain question, but BuildBot's output isn't particularly nice to look at..</p>

<p>..and others, <a href=""http://buildbot.python.org/stable/"">BuildBot</a> looks rather.. archaic</p>

<p>I'm currently playing with Hudson, but it is very Java-centric (although with <a href=""http://redsolo.blogspot.com/2007/11/hudson-embraces-python.html"">this guide</a>, I found it easier to setup than BuildBot, and produced more info)</p>

<p>Basically: is there any Continuous Integration systems aimed at python, that produce lots of shiny graphs and the likes?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this time the Jenkins project has replaced Hudson as the community version of the package. The original authors have moved to this project as well. Jenkins is now a standard package on Ubuntu/Debian, RedHat/Fedora/CentOS, and others. The following update is still essentially correct. The starting point to do this with <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org"">Jenkins</a> is different.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> After trying a few alternatives, I think I'll stick with Hudson. <a href=""http://integrityapp.com/"">Integrity</a> was nice and simple, but quite limited. I think <a href=""http://buildbot.net/trac"">Buildbot</a> is better suited to having numerous build-slaves, rather than everything running on a single machine like I was using it.</p>

<p>Setting Hudson up for a Python project was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download Hudson from <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"">http://hudson-ci.org/</a></li>
<li>Run it with <code>java -jar hudson.war</code></li>
<li>Open the web interface on the default address of <code>http://localhost:8080</code></li>
<li>Go to Manage Hudson, Plugins, click ""Update"" or similar</li>
<li>Install the Git plugin (I had to set the <code>git</code> path in the Hudson global preferences)</li>
<li>Create a new project, enter the repository, SCM polling intervals and so on</li>
<li>Install <code>nosetests</code> via <code>easy_install</code> if it's not already</li>
<li>In the a build step, add <code>nosetests --with-xunit --verbose</code></li>
<li>Check ""Publish JUnit test result report"" and set ""Test report XMLs"" to <code>**/nosetests.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That's all that's required. You can setup email notifications, and <a href=""http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins"">the plugins</a> are worth a look. A few I'm currently using for Python projects:</p>

<p>I often find myself using the % operator to strings with a dictionary of names and values to interpolate.  Often the names in the string is just the names of local variables.  So (with the answer below) I can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>message = '''Name: %(name)s
ZIP: %(zip)s

Dear %(name)s,
...''' % dict((x, locals()[x]) for x in ['name', 'zip'])
</code></pre>
",given list variable names python create dictionary variable names keys variables values list variable names like foo bar baz originally asked convert list variables see greg hewgills answer convert dictionary keys variable names strings values values variables foo foo bar bar baz baz im reasking question came name listofvariablenames dname evalname improved upon update responding question comment id want often find using operator strings dictionary names values interpolate often names string names local variables answer something like message name names zip zips dear names dictx localsx name zip

232008,237214,Will Django be a good choice for a permissions based web-app?,"<p>I've been exploring the details of Django for about a week now and like what I see. However I've come upon some.. negativity in relation to fine-grained control of permissions to the CRUD interface.</p>

<p>What I'm writing is an Intranet client management web-app. The organisation is about 6 tiers, and I need to restrict access to client groups based on tiers. Continually expanding. I have a fairly good idea how I'm going to do this, but am not sure if I'll be able to integrate it well into the pre-built admin interface. </p>

<p>I've done absolutely zero Django development otherwise I'd probably have a better idea on whether this would work or not. I probably won't use Django if the generated admin interface is going to be useless to this project - but like I said, there is a heavy reliance on fine-grained custom permissions.</p>

<p>Will Django let me build custom permissions/rules and integrate it seamlessly into the admin CRUD interface?</p>

<p>Update One: I want to use the admin app to minimise the repitition of generating CRUD interfaces, so yes I consider it a must have.</p>

<p>Update Two:</p>

<p>I want to describe the permissions required for this project.</p>

<p>A client can belong to one or many 'stores'. Full time employees should only be able to edit clients at their store (even if they belong to another store). However, they should not be able to see/edit clients at another store. Casuals should only be able to view clients based on what store they are rostered too (or if the casual is logged in as the store user - more likely).</p>

<p>Management above them need to be able to see all employees for the stores they manage, nothing more.</p>

<p>Senior management should be able to edit ALL employees and grant permissions below themselves.</p>

<p>After reading the django documentation, it says you can't (autmoatically) set permissions for a sub-set of a group. Only the entire group. Is it easy enough to mock up your own permissions for this purpose?</p>

<p>We're using the <a href=""http://codespeak.net/icalendar/"" rel=""nofollow"">iCalendar python module</a> to load and save ics files.</p>

<p>The following script is a simplified version of our test.  The script works fine in 'summer' and fails in 'winter', as of this morning.  The failure can be reproduced by setting the clock back manually.  Here's the output of the script:</p>

<pre><code>[root@ana icalendar]# date 10250855

</code></pre>

<p>And here is the <a href=""https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/browser/tests/icalendar/dst.py"" rel=""nofollow"">whole script</a>.</p>

<p>So, questions:
 - why would my current time (and which part of DST I'm in) affect the loading/saving/parsing of timestamps ? I would expect it not to.
 - how would you unit test this kind of bug, if it is a bug ? Obviously, I don't want my unit tests to reset the clock on my computer.</p>

<p>I know dictionary.items() is a list of tuples, but I can't seem to figure out how to make a nice format that is also compatible with the SetValue() method of wxPython.</p>

<p>I've also tried creating a string and passing that string to SetValue() but, again, I can only get one item in the tuple or the other, not both.</p>

<p>How would you refactor this so it's more dynamic?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I guess what I want to do is something like this:
Have a tuple (like the one I commented out) and iterate over it 3 times, each time making a new value (for each skill) based on the modifier for each particular range. The resulting value is then automatically assigned to it's respective variable.</p>

<p>In my head, it makes sense. But when I actually try to code it, I get lost. The problem, I think, is that this is the first ""real"" program I've written; all I've done before are small scripts.</p>

<p>This is only the 0.1 version of my program, so it's not critical to refactor it now. However, it seems very un-Pythonic to do this manually and I also want to ""future-proof"" this in case things change down the road.</p>

<p>I want a variable with 375 (the Revision). It's easy enough with put $Rev$ into a variable to keep track of changes on a file. However, I would like to keep track of the repository's version, and I understand (and it seems based on my tests) that $Rev$ only updates when the file changes.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts turn to using the svn/libsvn module built in to Python, though I can't find any documentation on or examples of how to use them.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I've thought calling 'svn info' and regex'ing the code out, though that seems rather brutal. :)</p>

249110,249524,Django: Arbitrary number of unnamed urls.py parameters,"<p>I have a Django model with a large number of fields and 20000+ table rows.  To facilitate human readable URLs and the ability to break down the large list into arbitrary sublists, I would like to have a URL that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/browse/&lt;name1&gt;/&lt;value1&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;/&lt;value2&gt;/ .... etc ....
</code></pre>

<p>where 'name' maps to a model attribute and 'value' is the search criteria for that attribute.  Each ""name"" will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match.</p>

<p>Now, this could be handled with GET parameters, but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user's sake and the search engines.  These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model, so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs.</p>

<p>Ideally each name/value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code>, etc.  However, I don't believe it's possible to defined named patterns via a regex's matched text.  Am I wrong there?</p>

<p>So, it seems I need to do something like this:</p>

    url(r'^browse/(?:([\w]+)/([\w]+)/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)

<p>It seems this should match any sets of two name/value pairs.  While it matches it successfully, it only passes the last name/value pair as parameters to the view function.

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',

)
</code></pre>

<p>... and got the same problem, but this time <code>*args</code> only includes the last matched pattern.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of Django's url dispatcher, and/or Python's regex support?  It seems either of these methods should work.  Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional (.*) pattern?</p>

255157,255906,How to override HTTP request verb in GAE,"<p>In the context of a Google App Engine Webapp framework application:</p>

<p>I want to changed the request verb of a request in the case a
parameter _method is provided, for example if a POST request comes in
with a parameter _method=PUT, I need to change the request to call the
put method of the handler. This is to cope with the way prototype.js
works with verbs like PUT and DELETE(workaround for IE). Here is my
first attempt:</p>

<pre>
class MyRequestHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
   def initialize(self, request, response):
       m = request.get('_method')
       if m:

<p>The problem is, for some reason whenever the redirect is done, the
self.request.params are emptied by the time the handling method(put or
delete) is called, even though they were populated when initialize was
called. Anyone have a clue why this is? As a workaround I thought I
could clone the params at initialize() time, but .copy() did not work,
and I haven't found a way to do that either.</p>

could clone the params at initialize() time, but .copy() did not work,
and I haven't found a way to do that either.</p>

255476,255508,Browser-based application or stand-alone GUI app?,"<p>I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't find it. </p>

<p>What are the benefits/limitations of using a browser-based interface for a stand-alone application vs. using a normal GUI framework?</p>

<p>I'm working on a Python program currently implement with wxPython for the GUI. The application is simply user-entry forms and dialogs. I am considering moving to PyQt because of the widgets it has (for future expansion), then I realized I could probably just use a browser to do much of the same stuff.</p>

<p>The application currently doesn't require Internet access, though it's a possibility in the future. I was thinking of using <a href=""http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/"">Karrigell</a> for the web framework if I go browser-based.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> For clarification, as of right now the application would be browser-based, not web-based. All the information would be stored locally on the client computer; no server calls would need to be made and no Internet access required (it may come later though). It would simply be a browser GUI instead of a wxPython/PyQt GUI. Hope that makes sense.</p>

260056,260077,Hashtable/dictionary/map lookup with regular expressions,"<p>I'm trying to figure out if there's a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a dictionary (or a hash, or a map, or whatever your favorite language calls it) where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys.  For example (in Python syntax):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict = { re.compile(r'foo.') : 12, re.compile(r'^FileN.*$') : 35 }
&gt;&gt;&gt; regex_dict['food']

<p>(Obviously the above example won't work as written in Python, but that's the sort of thing I'd like to be able to do.)</p>

<p>I can think of a naive way to implement this, in which I iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them, but then I lose the O(1) lookup time of a hash map and instead have O(n), where n is the number of keys in my dictionary.  This is potentially a big deal, as I expect this dictionary to grow very large, and I will need to search it over and over again (actually I'll need to iterate over it for every line I read in a text file, and the files can be hundreds of megabytes in size).</p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this, without resorting to O(n) efficiency?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you know of a way to accomplish this sort of a lookup in a database, that would be great, too.</p>

<p>(Any programming language is fine -- I'm using Python, but I'm more interested in the data structures and algorithms here.)</p>

<p>Someone pointed out that more than one match is possible, and that's absolutely correct.  Ideally in this situation I'd like to return a list or tuple containing all of the matches.  I'd settle for the first match, though.</p>

<p>I can't see O(1) being possible in that scenario; I'd settle for anything less than O(n), though.

263550,263583,"We have a graphical designer, now they want a text based designer. Suggestions?","<p>I'm sorry I could not think of a better title.</p>

<p>The problem is the following:</p>

<p>For our customer we have created (as part of a larger application) a
graphical designer which they can use to build ""scenario's"".</p>

<p>These scenario's consist of ""Composites"" which in turn consist
of ""Commands"". These command objects all derive from CommandBase and
implement an interface called ICompilable.</p>

<p>The scenario class also implements ICompilable. When Compile() is called
on a command an array of bytes is returned which can then be send to the device
for which they are intended (can't disclose to much info about that hardware, sorry)</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea:</p>

<pre><code>var scenario = new Scenario();

scenario.Add(new DelayCommand(1));
scenario.Add(new CountWithValueCommand(1,ActionEnum.Add,1));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new WaitCommand(3));
scenario.Add(new DirectPowerCommand(23,false,150));
scenario.Add(new SkipIfCommand(1,OperatorEnum.SmallerThan,10));
scenario.Add(new JumpCommand(2));

byte[] compiledData = scenario.Compile();
</code></pre>

<p>The graphical designer abstracts all this from the user and allows
him (or her) to simply drag en drop composites onto the designer surface.
(Composites can group commands so we can provide building blocks for returning tasks)</p>

<p>Recently our customer came to us and said, ""well the designer is really cool,
but we have some people who would rather have some kind of programming language,
just something simple.""</p>

<p>(Simple to them of course)</p>

<p>I would very much like to provide them with a simple language,
that can call various commmands and also replace SkipIfCommand with
a nicer structure, etc...</p>

<p>I have no idea where to start or what my options are (without breaking what we have)</p>

<p>I have heard about people embedding languages such as Python,
people writing their own language an parsers, etc...</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>PS: Users only work with composites, never with commands.
    Composites are loaded dynamically at runtime (along with their graphical designer)
    and may be provided by third parties in seperate assemblies.</p>

265814,265839,How do I process a string such as this using regular expressions?,"<p>How can I create a regex for a string such as this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Most of these fields are just simple words, but some of them can be paths, such as FOLDERPATH, OUTPUTPATH, these paths can also be paths with a filename and wildcard appended.</p>

<p>Retention is a number, and transfer mode can be bin or ascii. The issue is, LOGTO which can be a path with the logfile name appended to it or can be NO, which means no log file.</p>

<p>The main issue, is the optional arguments, they are both numbers, and OFFSET can't exist without MAXSIZE, but MAXSIZE can exist without offset.</p>

loveserver love copy /hats* 300 ascii C:\Puppies\no\ C:\log\love.log 256

270879,278606,Efficiently updating database using SQLAlchemy ORM,"<p>I'm starting a new application and looking at using an ORM -- in particular, SQLAlchemy.</p>

<p>Say I've got a column 'foo' in my database and I want to increment it.  In straight sqlite, this is easy:</p>

","User Authentication in Django <p>is there any way of making sure that, one user is logged in only once?</p>

<p>I would like to avoid two different persons logging into the system with the same login/password.</p>

<p>I guess I could do it myself by checking in the django_session table before logging in the user, but I rather prefer using the framework, if there is already such functionality.</p>

<p>I have put together something that works - it uses a simple ProgressBar class (which simple returns a simple ASCII progress bar, as a string), and a loop of <code>open().read()</code> and <code>.write()</code> to do the actual copying. It displays the progress bar using <code>sys.stdout.write(""\r%s\r"" % (the_progress_bar))</code> which is a little hackish, but it works.</p>

<p>I'm running <code>SWIG Version 1.3.36</code> and calling swig with <code>-Wall</code> and I get no warnings.</p>

<p>I'm able to get access to a list but I get a bunch of warnings when compiling with <code>-Wall</code> (with <code>g++ (GCC) 4.2.4</code> ) the generated C++ code that say:</p>

<pre>
  warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
</pre>

<p>Am I exposing the function correctly? If so, what does the warning mean?</p>

<hr>

<p>These are the lines before the offending line in the same function:</p>

<pre>
SWIGINTERN PyObject *_wrap_IntVector_erase__SWIG_0(PyObject *SWIGUNUSEDPARM(self), PyObject *args) {
  PyObject *resultobj = 0;
  std::vector *arg1 = (std::vector *) 0 ;
  std::vector::iterator arg2 ;
  std::vector::iterator result;
  void *argp1 = 0 ;
  int res1 = 0 ;
  swig::PySwigIterator *iter2 = 0 ;
  int res2 ;
  PyObject * obj0 = 0 ;
  PyObject * obj1 = 0 ;

  if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args,(char *)""OO:IntVector_erase"",&obj0,&obj1)) SWIG_fail;
  res1 = SWIG_ConvertPtr(obj0, &argp1,SWIGTYPE_p_std__vectorT_int_std__allocatorT_int_t_t, 0 |  0 );
  if (!SWIG_IsOK(res1)) {
    SWIG_exception_fail(SWIG_ArgError(res1), ""in method '"" ""IntVector_erase"" ""', argument "" ""1"""" of type '"" ""std::vector *""""'""); 
  }
  arg1 = reinterpret_cast * >(argp1);

<p>And this is the offending line:</p>

<pre>
  res2 = SWIG_ConvertPtr(obj1, SWIG_as_voidptrptr(&iter2), swig::PySwigIterator::descriptor(), 0);
</pre>

<p>More code follows that.</p>

<p>This works perfectly on OS X using 2.5.1, but it doesn't work on my home box (Debian, Python 2.4 &amp; 2.5) or on RHEL 5 with Python 2.4.  On anything but OS X it doesn't error, but doesn't change the permissions either.  Any ideas why?  Also, how does <code>writestr()</code> work?  I know I'm using it incorrectly here.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this without <code>os.chmod</code> (the user extracting the file doesn't have permissions to use <code>os.chmod</code> after it's extracted)?  I have full write access to the zip file.</p>

","Pickled file won't load on Mac/Linux <p>I have an application that imports data from a pickled file. It works just fine in Windows but Mac and Linux behaviour is odd.</p>

<p>In OS X, the pickled file (file extension "".char"") is unavailable as a selection unless I set the file type to *.*. Then, if I select a file that has the .char extension, it won't load, giving the error</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>unpickle_file = cPickle.load(char_file)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>ValueError: could not convert string to float</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if I create a file that doesn't have the .char extension, that file will load up just fine.</p>

<p>In Linux, when I use the ""file open"" dialog, my pickled files aren't visible, whether or not they have a file extension. However, I can see them under Nautilus or Dolphin. They simply don't exist to my application though.</p>

<p>I need to solve using gauss-seidel so I need to rearrange the equations for x, y, and z:</p>

<pre><code>x=(11+2y-1z)/4
y=(-6-x+3z)/5
z=(7-2x-2y)/7

<p>Here is the code I use to rearrange the equations. <code>b</code> is a matrix of coefficients and <code>y</code> is the answer vector:</p>

287757,287942,Python's ConfigParser unique keys per section,"<p>I read the part of <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html"">the docs</a> and saw that the <code>ConfigParser</code> returns a list of key/value pairs for the options within a section. I figured that keys did not need to be unique within a section, otherwise the parser would just return a mapping. I designed my config file schema around this assumption, then sadly realized that this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ConfigParser import ConfigParser
&gt;&gt;&gt; from StringIO import StringIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; fh = StringIO(""""""

&gt;&gt;&gt; parser = ConfigParser()
&gt;&gt;&gt; parser.readfp(fh)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print parser.items('Some Section')
[('spam', 'ham')]

<p>Then I went back and found the part of the docs that I <em>should</em> have read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sections are normally stored in a
  builtin dictionary. An alternative
  dictionary type can be passed to the
  ConfigParser constructor. For example,
  if a dictionary type is passed that
  sorts its keys, the sections will be
  sorted on write-back, as will be the
  keys within each section.</p>
</blockquote>

Is there a simpler way to prevent key/value collapse that I'm missing? Instead of making a crazy adapter (that could break if <code>ConfigParser</code>'s implementation changes) should I just write a variant of the <code>ConfigParser</code> itself?</p>

290456,290547,Using python to build web applications,"<p>This is a follow-up to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/269417/which-language-should-i-use"">two</a> <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271488/linking-languages"">questions</a> I asked a week or so back. The upshot of those was that I was building a prototype of an AI-based application for the web, and I wondered what language(s) to use. The conclusion seemed to be that I should go for something like python and then convert any critical bits into something faster like Java or C/C++.</p>

<p>That sounds fine to me, but I'm wondering now whether python is really the right language to use for building a web application. Most web applications I've worked on in the past were C/C++ CGI and then php. The php I found much easier to work with as it made linking the user interface to the back-end so much easier, and also it made more logical sense to me. </p>

<p>I've not used python before, but what I'm basically wondering is how easy is CGI programming in python? Will I have to go back to the tedious way of doing it in C/C++ where you have to store HTML code in templates and have the CGI read them in and replace special codes with appropriate values or is it possible to have the templates <em>be</em> the code as with php?</p>

<p>I'm probably asking a deeply ignorant question here, for which I apologise, but hopefully someone will know what I'm getting at! My overall question is: is writing web applications in python a good idea, and is it as easy as it is with php?</p>

","How do I filter ForeignKey choices in a Django ModelForm? <p>Say I have the following in my <code>models.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Company(models.Model):
   name = ...

class Rate(models.Model):
   company = models.ForeignKey(Company)
   name = ...

class Client(models.Model):
   name = ...
   company = models.ForeignKey(Company)
   base_rate = models.ForeignKey(Rate)
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. there are multiple <code>Companies</code>, each having a range of <code>Rates</code> and <code>Clients</code>.  Each <code>Client</code> should have a base <code>Rate</code> that is chosen from it's parent <code>Company's Rates</code>, not another <code>Company's Rates</code>.</p>

<p>When creating a form for adding a <code>Client</code>, I would like to remove the <code>Company</code> choices (as that has already been selected via an ""Add Client"" button on the <code>Company</code> page) and limit the <code>Rate</code> choices to that <code>Company</code> as well.</p>

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I parse the document using lxml.html, I can get the IMG with an xpath just fine:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; root = lxml.html.fromstring(doc)
&gt;&gt;&gt; root.xpath(""//img"")
[&lt;Element img at 1879e30&gt;]

<p>However, if I parse the document as XML and try to get the IMG tag, I get an empty result:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tree = etree.parse(StringIO(doc))
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.getroot().xpath(""//img"")
[]

<p>I can navigate to the element directly:</p>

&lt;Element {http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img at f56810&gt;

<p>But of course that doesn't help me process arbitrary documents.  I would also expect to be able to query etree to get an xpath expression that will directly identify this element, which, technically I can do:</p>

298446,298489,Looping in Django forms,"<p>I've just started building a prototype application in Django. I started out by working through the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">Django app tutorial on the Django site</a> which was pretty helpful, and gave me what I needed to get started. Now I have a couple of what I hope are very simple questions:</p>

<p>I want to put a loop into views.py, looping over a set of variables that have been passed in from a form. So I have a load of items in the HTML form, each of which has a SELECT drop-down list for people to select a score from 0-10, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""score1""&gt;
  &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have, let's say, 100 of these variables, score1, score2, score3, ..., score99, score100. When the form is submitted, I want to loop through each of these variables and see if it's been set (i.e. is not 0) and if so, I want to store that value in a suitable place in the database. My problem is that I can't figure out how to loop through those variables.
I'm guessing that I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for o in request.POST.all

endfor
</code></pre>

<p>but then I'm really not sure what to do with that.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for someone to write the code for me, really: I just would like some guidance on how to write a loop like this in python / Django, and also maybe some pointers as to a good reference guide I can either see online or buy that will give me access to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also, the select object above I created pretty much by hand, and I'd really like to be able to ue a loop to generate it in the template in the first place. My template currently has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
{% for movie in movie_list %}
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; {{ movie }} &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;select name=""score{{ movie.id }}""&gt;
         &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;

<p>I feel like there must be a way to create a simple loop that counts from 1 to 10 that would generate most of those options for me, but I can't figure out how to do that...</p>
","Looping in Django forms <p>I've just started building a prototype application in Django. I started out by working through the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/"" rel=""nofollow"">Django app tutorial on the Django site</a> which was pretty helpful, and gave me what I needed to get started. Now I have a couple of what I hope are very simple questions:</p>

<p>I want to put a loop into views.py, looping over a set of variables that have been passed in from a form. So I have a load of items in the HTML form, each of which has a SELECT drop-down list for people to select a score from 0-10, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=""score1""&gt;
  &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have, let's say, 100 of these variables, score1, score2, score3, ..., score99, score100. When the form is submitted, I want to loop through each of these variables and see if it's been set (i.e. is not 0) and if so, I want to store that value in a suitable place in the database. My problem is that I can't figure out how to loop through those variables.
I'm guessing that I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for o in request.POST.all

endfor
</code></pre>

<p>but then I'm really not sure what to do with that.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for someone to write the code for me, really: I just would like some guidance on how to write a loop like this in python / Django, and also maybe some pointers as to a good reference guide I can either see online or buy that will give me access to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also, the select object above I created pretty much by hand, and I'd really like to be able to ue a loop to generate it in the template in the first place. My template currently has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
{% for movie in movie_list %}
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; {{ movie }} &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
       &lt;select name=""score{{ movie.id }}""&gt;
         &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;

       &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

{% endfor %}

298779,298835,Form (or Formset?) to handle multiple table rows in Django,"<p>I'm working on my first Django application. In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating (out of 10) to each film. I've been able to use the {{ form }} and {{ formset }} syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once? </p>

<p>At first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I can't see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Currently, my views.py has this code:</p>

<pre><code>def survey(request):
        ScoreFormSet = formset_factory(ScoreForm)
        if request.method == 'POST':
                formset = ScoreFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)
                if formset.is_valid():
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        else:
                formset = ScoreFormSet()
        return render_to_response('cf/survey.html', {
                'formset':formset,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>And my survey.html has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/survey/"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
{{ formset }}
&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;input type = ""submit"" value = ""Submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py are:</p>

<pre><code>class Score(models.Model):
        movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie)
        score = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)

class ScoreForm(ModelForm):
        class Meta:
                model = Score
</code></pre>

<p>So, in case the above is not clear, what I'm aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.</p>

<p>If anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, I'd be most grateful.</p>

301134,301146,Dynamic module import in Python,"<p>I'm writing a Python application that takes as a command as an argument, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ python myapp.py command1
</code></pre>

<p>I want the application to be extensible, that is, to be able to add new modules that implement new commands without having to change the main application source. The tree looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>myapp/
    __init__.py
    commands/
        __init__.py
        command1.py
        command2.py
    foo.py
    bar.py
</code></pre>

<p>So I want the application to find the available command modules at runtime and execute the appropriate one.</p>

<p>Currently this is implemented something like:</p>

<pre><code>command = sys.argv[1]
try:
    command_module = __import__(""myapp.commands.%s"" % command, fromlist=[""myapp.commands""])
except ImportError:
    # Display error message

command_module.run()

<p>Note that I specifically don't want to get in to using eggs or extension points. This is not an open-source project and I don't expect there to be ""plugins"". The point is to simplify the main application code and remove the need to modify it each time a new command module is added.</p>

<p>Now, I'm relatively new to python, but the two things I've tested so far haven't worked. First I used httplib, with putrequest() (passing the parameters within the URL), and putheader(). This didn't seem to follow the redirects.</p>

<p>Then I tried urllib and urllib2, passing both headers and parameters as dicts. This seems to return the login page, instead of the page I'm trying to login to, I guess it's because of lack of cookies or something.</p>

302379,305649,Calculate exact result of complex throw of two D30,"<p>Okay, this bugged me for several years, now. If you sucked in statistics and higher math at school, turn away, <em>now</em>. Too late.</p>

<p>Okay. Take a deep breath. Here are the rules. Take <em>two</em> thirty sided dice (yes, <a href=""http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/k/koplow/dice/d30"" rel=""nofollow"">they do exist</a>) and roll them simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the two numbers</li>
<li>If both dice show &lt;= 5 or >= 26, throw again and <em>add</em> the result to what you have</li>
<li>If one is &lt;= 5 and the other >= 26, throw again and <em>subtract</em> the result from what 
you have</li>
<li>Repeat until either is > 5 and &lt; 26!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you write some code (see below), roll those dice a few million times and you count how often you receive each number as the final result, you get a curve that is pretty flat left of 1, around 45Â° degrees between 1 and 60 and flat above 60. The chance to roll 30.5 or better is greater than 50%, to roll better than 18 is 80% and to roll better than 0 is 97%.</p>

<p>Now the question: Is it possible to write a program to <em>calculate</em> the <em>exact</em> value f(x), i.e. the probability to roll a certain value?</p>

303664,303697,Newbie Python Question about tuples,"<p>I am new to Python, and I'm working on writing some database code using the <code>cx_Oracle</code> module.

<p>I would like to modify a set of mp3 files in a fairly simple way. I am not so much interested in the ID3 tags but in the audio itself. I want to be able to delete sections (e.g. drop 10 seconds from the 3rd minute), and insert sections (e.g. add credits to the end.)</p>

<p>My understanding is that the mp3 format is lossy, and so decoding it to (for example) PCM format, making the modifications, and then encoding it again to MP3 will lower the audio quality. (I would love to hear that I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I <em>conjecture</em> that if I stay in mp3 format, there will be some sort of minimum frame or packet-size to deal with, so the granularity of the operations may be coarser. I can live with that, as long as I get an accuracy of within a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""http://pymedia.org/"">PyMedia</a>, but it requires me to migrate to PCM to process the data. Similarly, <a href=""http://lame.sourceforge.net"">LAME</a> wants to help me encode, but not access the data in place. I have seen several other libraries that only deal with the ID3 tags.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a Python MP3 library? Alternatively, can you disabuse me of my assumption that going to PCM and back is bad and avoidable?</p>

311763,311778,Parsing GPS receiver output via regex in Python,"<p>I have a friend who is finishing up his masters degree in aerospace engineering. For his final project, he is on a small team tasked with writing a program for tracking weather balloons, rockets and satellites. The program receives input from a GPS device, does calculations with the data, and uses the results of those calculations to control a series of motors designed to orientate a directional communication antenna, so the balloon, rocket or satellite always stays in focus.</p>

<p>Though somewhat of a (eternal) beginner myself, I have more programming experience than my friend. So when he asked me for advice, I convinced him to write the program in Python, my language of choice.</p>

<p>At this point in the project, we are working on the code that parses the input from the GPS device. Here is some example input, with the data we need to extract in bold:</p>

<p>$GPRMC,092204.999,<strong>4250.5589,S,14718.5084,E</strong>,1,12,24.4,<strong>89.6</strong>,M,,,0000*1F

<p>Here is some further explanation of the data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I looks like I'll need five things
  out of every line. And bear in mind
  that any one of these area's may be
  empty. Meaning there will be just two
  commas right next to each other. Such
  as ',,,' There are two fields that may
  be full at any time. Some of them only
  have two or three options that they
  may be but I don't think I should be
  counting on that.""</p>

<p>Two days ago my friend was able to acquire the full log from the GPS receiver used to track a recent weather balloon launch. The data is quite long, so I put it all in <a href=""http://pastebin.com/f5f5cf9ab"">this pastebin</a>.</p>

<p>I am still rather new with regular expressions myself, so I am looking for some assistance.</p>

<p>Though somewhat of a (eternal) beginner myself, I have more programming experience than my friend. So when he asked me for advice, I convinced him to write the program in Python, my language of choice.</p>

<p>At this point in the project, we are working on the code that parses the input from the GPS device. Here is some example input, with the data we need to extract in bold:</p>

<p>$GPRMC,092204.999,<strong>4250.5589,S,14718.5084,E</strong>,1,12,24.4,<strong>89.6</strong>,M,,,0000*1F

<p>Here is some further explanation of the data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I looks like I'll need five things
  out of every line. And bear in mind
  that any one of these area's may be
  empty. Meaning there will be just two
  commas right next to each other. Such
  as ',,,' There are two fields that may
  be full at any time. Some of them only
  have two or three options that they
  may be but I don't think I should be
  counting on that.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two days ago my friend was able to acquire the full log from the GPS receiver used to track a recent weather balloon launch. The data is quite long, so I put it all in <a href=""http://pastebin.com/f5f5cf9ab"">this pastebin</a>.</p>

<p>I am still rather new with regular expressions myself, so I am looking for some assistance.</p>

<p>What I saw on some sites, and really liked, is that when user clicks a link leading to a place restricted to logged-only users, instead of getting redirected to a login page, he/she gets a popup window (via JavaScript) asking him/her to log in or register. There's no redirection part, so no need for a user to use the ""back"" key if he/she decides he/she really doesn't like the website enough to waste the time registering.</p>

<p>So, the qestion is:  how would you manage the task of automatically marking some links as ""restricted"" so JavaScript can handle their <code>onclick</code> event and display a ""please log in"" popup? </p>

313054,313105,Django Admin Interface Does Not Use Subclass's __unicode__(),"<p>(Django 1.x, Python 2.6.x)</p>

<p>I have models to the tune of:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal(models.Model):
  pass

class Cat(Animal):
  def __unicode__(self):
    return ""This is a cat""

class Dog(Animal):
  def __unicode__(self):
    return ""This is a dog""

class AnimalHome(models.Model):
  animal = models.ForeignKey(Animal)
</code></pre>

<p>I have instantiated no Animals, because this is supposed to be a virtual class.  I have instantiated Cats and Dogs, but in the Admin Page for AnimalHome, my choices for Animals are displayed as ""Animal object"" (the default __unicode__(), I guess) as opposed to the __unicode__ I have defined for the two subclasses.  Help.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>The abstract base class issue is a red herring wrt to this question, I think.  Even if Animal was not supposed to be abstract, I still have the problem that, for some reason, since the ForeignKey is defined on Animal and not one of its subclasses, the superclass method is being called instead of the subclass.  In OO programming when you call object.method() you're supposed to get the lowest-subclass's implementation, and you have to do extra work to get any superclass's implementation.  So why is it that having __unicode__ defined on the subclasses is not sufficient for --- actually the problem might be that __unicode__ is not getting called at all because introspection on the Animal class reveals that it's not defined.  So maybe if I define __unicode__ for Animal and have it call subclasses' __unicode__ I could get the desired effect.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay, I think that I understand the ORM issues.  Both these answers have helped me understand this, thank you.  While experimenting with this, I discovered that when Django saves a subclassed model, it does two things: (1) it creates a row for the subclassed object in the superclass's table, and (2) it makes the PK in the subclass table identical to the PK assigned in the superclass table.  This PK in the subclass table is named superclass_ptr.  Based upon this I've concocted the following.  I'd appreciate feedback.</p>

<pre><code>Class Animal(models.Model)
  def __unicode__(self):
    if Dog.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Dog.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    elif Cat.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:
      return unicode(Cat.objects.get(pk=self.pk))
    else:
      return ""An Animal!""
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>It seems that Lawrence is most on-point wrt this question.  Cat and Dog will have disjoint PK sets (and any subclass of Animal will have a PK identical to the record of its superclass), but unfortunately Django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la: ""I'm an Animal.  I know Animals have subclasses Dog and Cat.  Specifically, I'm Animal number 3, and furthermore I just checked and there's a Cat number 3 too.  That means that I'm actually Cat number 3"".  Even though this seems entirely possible and very reasonable (since a Cat won't do anything an Animal couldn't do itself) using Python's introspection.  Thank you all.</p>

314234,314296,Are there problems developing Django on Jython?,"<p><b> The background </b> </p>

<p>I'm building a fair-sized web application with a friend in my own time, and we've decided to go with the Django framework on Python. Django provides us with a lot of features we're going to need, so please don't suggest alternative frameworks.</p>

<p>The only decision I'm having trouble with, is whether we use Python or Jython to develop our application. Now I'm pretty familiar with Java and could possibly benefit from the libraries within the JDK. I know minimal Python, but am using this project as an opportunity to learn a new language - so the majority of work will be written in Python.</p>

<p>The attractiveness of Jython is of course the JVM. The number of python/django enabled web-hosts is extremely minimal - whereas I'm assuming I could drop a jython/django application on a huge variety of hosts. This isn't a massive design decision, but still one I think needs to be decided. I'd really prefer jython over python for the jvm accessibility alone.</p>

<p><b> Questions </b>  </p>

<p>Does Jython have many limitations compared to regular python? Will running django on jython cause problems? How quick is the Jython team to release updates alongside Python? Will Django work as advertised on Jython (with very minimal pre-configuration)?</p>

<p><b> Decision </b></p>

<p>Thanks for the helpful comments. What I think I'm going to do is develop in Jython for the JVM support - but to try to only use Python code/libraries. Portability isn't a major concern so if I need a library in the JDK (not readily available in python), I'll use it. As long as Django is fully supported, I'm happy.</p>

<p>I marked an answer down below. It is not what I am getting, so I need to figure out if the problem is somewhere else in my code.</p>

319896,321134,How do I skip processing the attachments of an email which is an attachment of a different email,"<p>using jython</p>

<p>I have a situation where emails come in with different attachments. Certain file types I process others I ignore and dont write to file.
I am caught in a rather nasty situation, because sometimes people send an email as an attachment, and that attached email has legal attachments. </p>

<p>What I want to do is skip that attached email and all its attachments.</p>

<p>using python/jythons std email lib how can i do this?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>to make it clearer</p>

<p>I need to parse an email (named ROOT email), I want to get the attachments from this email using jython.
Next certain attachments are supported ie .pdf .doc etc
now it just so happens that, the clients send an email (ROOT email) with another email message (CHILD email) as an attachment, and in CHILD email it has .pdf attachments and such like.</p>

<p>What I need is: to get rid of any CHILD emails attached to the ROOT email AND the CHILD emails attachments. What happens is I walk over the whole email and it just parses every attachment, BOTH ROOT attachments and CHILD attachments as if they were ROOT attachments.</p>

<p>I cannot have this. I am only interested in ROOT attachements that are legal ie .pdf .doc. xls .rtf .tif .tiff</p>

<p>That should do for now, I have to run to catch a bus!
thanks!</p>

327223,327295,Memory Efficient Alternatives to Python Dictionaries,"<p>In one of my current side projects, I am scanning through some text looking at the frequency of word triplets.  In my first go at it, I used the default dictionary three levels deep.  In other words, topDictionary[word1][word2][word3] returns the number of times these words appear in the text, topdictionary[word1][word2] returns a dictionary with all the words that appeared following words 1 and 2, etc.</p>

<p>This functions correctly, but it is very memory intensive.  In my initial tests it used something like 20 times the memory of just storing the triplets in a text file, which seems like an overly large amount of memory overhead.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that many of these dictionaries are being created with many more slots than are actually being used, so I want to replace the dictionaries with something else that is more memory efficient when used in this manner.  I would strongly prefer a solution that allows key lookups along the lines of the dictionaries.</p>

<p>From what I know of data structures, a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or AVL would probably be ideal, but I would really prefer not to implement them myself.  If possible, I'd prefer to stick with standard python libraries, but I'm definitely open to other alternatives if they would work best.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions for me?</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  A few of the answers so far have suggested using tuples, which didn't really do much for me when I condensed the first two words into a tuple.  I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (ie I want something like the result of topDict[word1,word2].keys() ).  </p>

<p>The current dataset I am playing around with is the most recent version of <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/wikipedia-for-schools.htm"">Wikipedia For Schools</a>.  The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.  I know that there will be some additional overhead for pointers and whatnot, but the difference seems excessive.</p>

I am hesitant to use all three as a key since I want it to be easy to look up all third words given the first two.  (ie I want something like the result of topDict[word1,word2].keys() ).  </p>

<p>The current dataset I am playing around with is the most recent version of <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/wikipedia-for-schools.htm"">Wikipedia For Schools</a>.  The results of parsing the first thousand pages, for example, is something like 11MB for a text file where each line is the three words and the count all tab separated.  Storing the text in the dictionary format I am now using takes around 185MB.  I know that there will be some additional overhead for pointers and whatnot, but the difference seems excessive.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you all for the responses so far.</p>

<p>My plan was to use a dictionary, where the value of t is the key for the dictionary, and the value against the key would be a list. I could then append each (x,y) to the list. Something like:</p>

<pre><code># where t = 0, c = (4,7), d = {}

<p>I am planning to store user accounts in a text file using the same format (roughly) as /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>Despite not using the system-level password files, using crypt seemed
to be a good practice to use, as opposed to storing passwords in
cleartext. (While crypt is certainly better than storing passwords in

for a password.""</p>

<p>Huh? If I'm creating the crypted password (as in, when creating a user
record) how can I use the crypted password as a salt? It
doesn't exist yet. (I'm assuming that you must use the same salt for creating and checking a password.)</p>

<p>I've tried using the plaintext password as a salt. This does
work, but has two problems; one easily overcome, and one serious:</p>

<p>1) The first two letters of the plaintext password are included in the
crypted password. You can fix this by not writing the first two
characters to the file:</p>

<pre><code>user_record = '%s:%s:%s' % (user_name, crypted_pw[2:], user_type)

<p>2) By using the plaintext password as the salt, you would seem to be
reducing the amount of entropy in the system. Possibly I'm
misunderstanding the purpose of the salt.</p>

<p>The best practice I've been able to derive is to use the first two
characters from the username as the salt. Would this be appropriate,
or is there something I've missed that makes that a bad move?</p>

<p>My understanding of a salt is that it prevents pre-computing password
hashes from a dictionary. I could use a standard salt for all

335582,335640,Python: smtpd (or alternative) for production mail receiving?,"<p>I'm looking to do various processing of email - eg. inspect the headers, and if they meet some criteria (look like spam), drop the connection, or inspect the recipient list and perform special filtering.</p>

<p>Looks like Python's smtpd library provides a nice and simple interface for processing the received email. </p>

<p>To deal with the message before it's fully processed (eg. to drop the message in case the headers look like spam), should I be using handle_connect? Are the internal APIs (other than process_message) documented somewhere? Example code anywhere?</p>

<p>Also, has anyone used smtpd in production? Any thoughts on reliability, etc?</p>

<p>Regarding Twisted: I've attempted to embrace Twisted several times and quite like the deferred model, but it's a bit too complex for my current taste. I'll give it another look, but for now I'm more interested in non-Twisted implementations.</p>

336013,339212,How to handle a glade project with many windows,"<p>I'm working on a PyGTK/glade application that currently has 16 windows/dialogs and is about 130KB, and will eventually have around 25 windows/dialogs and be around 200KB.  Currently, I'm storing all the windows in one monolithic glade file.  When I run a window I call it like...</p>

<pre><code>self.wTree = gtk.glade.XML(""interface.glade"", ""WindowXYZ"")
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder if it would be a better idea to split each window into it's own glade file.  Instead of one glade file with 25 windows/dialogs I'd have 25 glade files with one window/dialog each and call it like so:</p>

<pre><code>self.wTree = gtk.glade.XML(""windowxyz.glade"")
</code></pre>

<p>What do you guys think is the best way to do this?  Is one method more resource intensive than another?

For example, I name all my OK buttons ""windowxyz_ok"", but I could change it to simply ""ok"" instead.  Makes things simpler.  The downside is that it may be a bit less convenient to make changes to different windows.</p>

<p>In Flash, we have a shared library between our Flash apps - package xyz.

342434,345669,Python logging in Django,"<p>I'm developing a Django app, and I'm trying to use Python's logging module for error/trace logging.  Ideally I'd like to have different loggers configured for different areas of the site.  So far I've got all of this working, but one thing has me scratching my head.</p>

<p>I have the root logger going to sys.stderr, and I have configured another logger to write to a file.  This is in my settings.py file:</p>

<pre><code>sviewlog = logging.getLogger('MyApp.views.scans')
view_log_handler = logging.FileHandler('C:\\MyApp\\logs\\scan_log.log')
view_log_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
view_log_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'))
sviewlog.addHandler(view_log_handler)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems pretty simple.  Here's the problem, though: whatever I write to the sviewlog gets written to the log file twice.  The root logger only prints it once.  It's like addHandler() is being called twice.  And when I put my code through a debugger, this is exactly what I see.  The code in settings.py is getting executed twice, so two FileHandlers are created and added to the same logger instance.  But why?  And how do I get around this?</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what's going on here?  I've tried moving the sviewlog logger/handler instantiation code to the file where it's used (since that actually seems like the appropriate place to me), but I have the same problem there.  Most of the examples I've seen online use only the root logger, and I'd prefer to have multiple loggers.</p>

I've even written a <a href=""http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/05/31/a-tetris-clone-in-python-wxpython/"">Tetris clone</a> in it, and it was pretty smooth.</p>

<p>I wonder, what does Pygame offer in terms of graphics (leaving sound aside, for a moment) that wxPython can't do ? Is it somehow simpler/faster to do graphics in Pygame than in wxPython ? Is it even more cross-platform ?</p>

<p>It looks like I'm missing something here, but I don't know what.</p>

343517,343534,How do I work with multiple git branches of a python module?,"<p>I want to use git to allow me to work on several features in a module I'm writing concurrently. I'm currently using SVN, with only one workspace, so I just have the workspace on my PYTHONPATH. I'm realizing this is less than ideal, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest a more 'proper' way of doing this.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate with a hypothetical situation:
I say I have a module 'eggs', with sub-modules 'foo' and 'bar'. Components in 'bar' use code in foo, so eggs/bar/a.py may 'import eggs.foo'. </p>

<p>Say that 'eggs' is in a git repository. I want to try out some changes to 'foo', so I copy it. The problem is that 'import eggs.foo' in eggs/bar finds the original repository in the PYTHONPATH, so it ends up using the old 'foo' instead of my modified one. </p>

<p>How do I set myself up such that each copy of the module uses its own associated 'foo'? Thanks.</p>

<p>edit- Thanks for the pointer to relative imports. I've read up on it and I can see how to apply it. One problem I'd have with using it is that I've built up a fairly large codebase, and I haven't been too neat about it so most modules have a  quick 'self-test' under <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code>, which from what I've read does not play with relative imports: </p>

</ul>

<p>The other solution I've been able to google up is to deliberately manipulate sys.path, which seems like an even worse hack. Are there any other possibilities?</p>

<p>edit - Thanks for the suggestions. I'd originally misunderstood git branches, so as pointed out branches are exactly what I want. Nonetheless, I hadn't heard of relative imports before so thanks for that as well. I've learnt something new and may incorporate its use.</p>

347497,347588,Emitting headers from a tiny Python web-framework,"<p>I am writing a web-framework for Python, of which the goal is to be as ""small"" as possible (currently under 100 lines of code).. You can see the current code <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/pyerweb/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">on github</a></p>

<p>Basically it's written to be as simple to use as possible. An example ""Hello World"" like site:</p>

<pre><code>from pyerweb import GET, runner

@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return ""&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; would be the output HTML for the URL / ""

@GET(""/view/([0-9]+?)$"")
def view_something(id):
    return ""Viewing id %s"" % (id) # URL /view/123 would output ""Viewing id 123""

runner(url = ""/"", # url would be from a web server, in actual use
       output_helper = ""html_tidy"" # run returned HTML though ""HTML tidy""
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you have a function that returns HTML, and the GET decorator maps this to a URL.</p>

<p>When <code>runner()</code> is called, each decorated function is checked, if the URL regex matches the request URL, the function is run, and the output is sent to the browser.</p>

<p>Now, the problem - outputting headers. Currently for development I've just put a line before the <code>runner()</code> call which does <code>print Content-type:text/html\n</code> - this is obviously a bit limiting..</p>

<p>My first ideas was to have the functions return a dict, something like..</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return {
        ""html"": ""&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"",
        ""headers"": {""Location"":""http://google.com""}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like this - having to return a dict with a specifically named key isn't nearly as nice as just returning a string..</p>

<p>I could check if the returned data is a dict, if so use <code>returned_data['html']</code> as the output, if it's a string, there is no custom headers to be sent... but this means to go from no headers (which would be the case a huge majority of the time) to headers, you'd have to change the return function from <code>return my_html</code> to <code>return {'html':my_html}</code> which isn't very elegant either..</p>

<p>After writing this, I discovered ""Sinatra"" - a similar-in-use Ruby library, and looked at how it dealt with headers:</p>

<pre><code>get ""/"" do
    content_type 'text/css', :charset =&gt; 'utf-8'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like it could be nice enough in Python:</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    header(""location"", ""http://google.com"")
</code></pre>

<p>To implement this, I was considering changing how the functions are executed - instead of simply using the return value, I would change <code>sys.stdout</code> to a StringIO, so you could do..</p>

<pre><code>def index():
    print ""&lt;html&gt;""
    print ""&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Something&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;""
    print ""&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;""
    print ""&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>..without having to worry about concatenating a bunch of strings together. The upshot of this is I could have a separate stream for headers, so the above <code>header()</code> function would write to this.. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def header(name, value):
    pyerweb.header_stream.write(""%s: %s"" % (name, value))
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the question is, how would you output headers from this web-framework (mostly in terms of <em>use</em>, but to a lesser extent implementation)?</p>

<p>Now, the problem - outputting headers. Currently for development I've just put a line before the <code>runner()</code> call which does <code>print Content-type:text/html\n</code> - this is obviously a bit limiting..</p>

<p>My first ideas was to have the functions return a dict, something like..</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    return {
        ""html"": ""&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"",
        ""headers"": {""Location"":""http://google.com""}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like this - having to return a dict with a specifically named key isn't nearly as nice as just returning a string..</p>

<p>I could check if the returned data is a dict, if so use <code>returned_data['html']</code> as the output, if it's a string, there is no custom headers to be sent... but this means to go from no headers (which would be the case a huge majority of the time) to headers, you'd have to change the return function from <code>return my_html</code> to <code>return {'html':my_html}</code> which isn't very elegant either..</p>

<p>After writing this, I discovered ""Sinatra"" - a similar-in-use Ruby library, and looked at how it dealt with headers:</p>

<pre><code>get ""/"" do
    content_type 'text/css', :charset =&gt; 'utf-8'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like it could be nice enough in Python:</p>

<pre><code>@GET(""/"")
def index():
    header(""location"", ""http://google.com"")
</code></pre>

<p>To implement this, I was considering changing how the functions are executed - instead of simply using the return value, I would change <code>sys.stdout</code> to a StringIO, so you could do..</p>

<pre><code>def index():
    print ""&lt;html&gt;""
    print ""&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Something&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;""
    print ""&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;""
    print ""&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>..without having to worry about concatenating a bunch of strings together. The upshot of this is I could have a separate stream for headers, so the above <code>header()</code> function would write to this.. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def header(name, value):
    pyerweb.header_stream.write(""%s: %s"" % (name, value))
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the question is, how would you output headers from this web-framework (mostly in terms of <em>use</em>, but to a lesser extent implementation)?</p>
","emitting headers tiny python webframework writing webframework python goal small possible currently lines code see current code github basically written simple use possible example hello world like site pyerweb import get runner get def index return strongthisstrong would output html url getview def viewsomethingid return viewing id id url view would output viewing id runnerurl url would web server actual use outputhelper htmltidy run returned html though html tidy basically function returns html get decorator maps url runner called decorated function checked url regex matches request url function run output sent browser problem outputting headers currently development ive put line runner call print contenttypetexthtmln obviously bit limiting first ideas functions return dict something like get def index return html htmlbodybodyhtml headers locationhttpgooglecom really dont like return dict specifically named key isnt nearly nice returning string could check returned data dict use returneddatahtml output string custom headers sent means go headers would case huge majority time headers youd change return function return myhtml return htmlmyhtml isnt elegant either writing discovered sinatra similarinuse ruby library looked dealt headers get contenttype textcss charset utf end seems like could nice enough python get def index headerlocation httpgooglecom implement considering changing functions executed instead simply using return value would change sysstdout stringio could def index print html print headtitlesomethingtitlehead"" print ""<body>...</body>"" print ""</html> ..without worry concatenating bunch strings together. upshot could separate stream headers, header() function would write this.. something like: def header(name, value): pyerweb.header_stream.write(""%s: %s"" (name, value)) basically, question is, would output headers web-framework (mostly terms use, lesser extent implementation)?"
